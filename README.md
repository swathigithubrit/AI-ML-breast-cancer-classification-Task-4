AI-ML-breast-cancer-classification-Task-4
Predict breast cancer diagnosis (Malignant or Benign) using logistic regression in Python. Includes data cleaning, feature scaling, model training, evaluation with confusion matrix and ROC curve.


Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

This repository contains a complete machine learning project in Python to classify breast cancer tumors as Malignant (Cancerous) or Benign (Non-cancerous) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow, including:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Model training
- Evaluation with Confusion Matrix, ROC curve, and AUC
- Threshold tuning

üìå Dataset

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, typically available via UCI ML Repository or Kaggle.

- Each row represents measurements from a biopsy.
- Features are real-valued (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc.).
- Target variable:  
  - M (Malignant) ‚Üí 1
  - B (Benign) ‚Üí 0

üìå Project Steps

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading
- Loaded CSV data using pandas.
- Inspected structure with `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Cleaning
- Removed unnecessary columns:
  - `id` (identifier)
  - `Unnamed: 32` (empty/garbage)
- Stripped spaces from column names.
- Mapped `diagnosis` column to numeric `target`.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis
- Checked class balance using `value_counts`.
- Verified feature types and cleaned column list.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Train-Test Split
- Split data into 80% training and 20% testing.
- Used stratification to maintain class balance.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Scaling
- Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize features.
- Ensured mean=0, std=1 for better model convergence.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
- Trained a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn.
- Chose Logistic Regression for its interpretability and baseline performance.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Predictions
- Generated class predictions and probability scores.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation
- Created Confusion Matrix to assess TP, TN, FP, FN.
- Printed Classification Report with precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy.
- Plotted ROC Curve and calculated AUC score.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Threshold Tuning
- Experimented with changing the classification threshold from 0.5 to 0.4.
- Observed the effect on confusion matrix and metrics.

- Class 0 (Benign):
  - Precision: 0.96
    - 96% of predicted benign tumors were actually benign.
  - Recall: 0.99
    - 99% of actual benign tumors were correctly detected.
  - F1-score: 0.97
    - High balance of precision and recall.


- Class 1 (Malignant):
  - Precision: 0.97
    - 97% of predicted malignant tumors were actually malignant.
  - Recall: 0.93
    - 93% of actual malignant tumors were correctly detected.
  - F1-score: 0.95
    - Slightly lower recall than precision, but still strong.


- Accuracy: 0.96
  - Overall, 96% of test samples were classified correctly.


- Macro average:
  - Simple average across classes (treats classes equally).
  - Precision: 0.97, Recall: 0.96, F1-score: 0.96.


- Weighted average:
  - Accounts for class imbalance.
  - Precision: 0.97, Recall: 0.96, F1-score: 0.96.


This project builds a logistic regression model to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant with ~96% accuracy. Careful data cleaning, scaling, and evaluation (including ROC and confusion matrices) show the model‚Äôs strong ability to support early cancer diagnosis, highlighting the potential of machine learning in medical decision-making.
